### Used technologies
When compiling the application we used HTML5, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript. We used Node.js to create the back-end of our application and the connection between the client and the server is established via REST API made with Express. We created the database using MongoDB. To establish connection with the database server, we used the object oriented library Mongoose. We have merged this into main in our git repository. The backend is uploaded in Heroku and the fronend in Hera.
# Installation

```
Go to the back-end repository
```
$ cd ./back-end
```
Install the node modules
```
$ npm i
```
