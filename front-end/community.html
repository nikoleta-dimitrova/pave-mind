                    <p class="community-post-body">In short, my brain and body were fried. The exact reasons for burnout are always very personal and specific 
                        to an individual’s situation and personality. For me, important component was the combination of being an 
                        entrepreneur and having an ADHD brain. Being an entrepreneur is stressful for most people — some research 
                        suggests that you can be more at risk of due to being passionate about your work and operating under 
                        high uncertainty. Adding in the ADHD hyperfocus and relentless drive accelerated my pace but my crucial 
                        mistake was neglecting my health.</p>

                        <p class="community-comment-text">Accepting that body and mind are not separate: chronic stress affects both your brain and your body:
                            for me it had raised my cortisol levels and generally pushed my body balance completely out of whack.
                            I had to work on my interoception because not listening to my brain’s representation of sensations 
                            from my body meant I wasn’t aware when I was using up my body budget.</p>
