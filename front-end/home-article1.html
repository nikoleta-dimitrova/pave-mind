        <h1 id="article-title">What Is Academic Burnout?</h1>
        <img id="article-image" src="./Assets/Images/article1.svg" alt="">
        <p id="article-boldInfo">Feeling less motivated than usual? More exhausted and irritable? Less inspired and
            creative in your school work? You may have academic burnout, which is a very real condition that is both
            diagnosable and treatable with the right steps.</p>
        <p id="article-information">The first part of treating academic burnout is recognition and acknowledgement of
            the condition, followed by some serious commitment to change your current habits. You can overcome academic
            burnout, and prevent it from happening again! We’ll explain exactly how you can do so plus the best tips for
            avoiding burnout altogether. Academic burnout can be defined as a negative emotional, physical and mental
            reaction to prolonged study that results in exhaustion, frustration, lack of motivation and reduced ability
            in school. It is the culmination of many weeks or months studying the same material or working on the same
            project, or from continuous years of schooling.<br><br>

            This is not to be confused with the occasional feeling of frustration when you have been studying for hours
            on end, or tiredness from pulling an all-nighter. It is rather more of a chronic condition from long-term
            study or school work. Academic burnout symptoms are manifested in much more than just tiredness and feeling
            like you can’t attend another class. Burnout can cause real, psychosomatic problems such as headaches,
            insomnia and depression, which is why it is important to start taking steps to reverse burnout as soon as
            you recognize the symptoms. If you start recognizing some of the symptoms above in yourself, it’s time to
            make changes before you experience full-blown academic burnout.<br><br>

            Also, if you have a heavy semester or degree coming up, you may be worried about getting burnt out and
            looking to prevent it from the start. Good for you! There are many easy ways you can change your habits and
            lifestyle to prevent burnout in school. Enjoy Your Vacations: Take a real break from work and school on the
            weekends if possible. Try to rearrange your schedule to give yourself at least a day off every week. During
            school breaks, try to take vacations or staycations, where you truly give your mind time to rest.</p>
